# web-color-picker

(work in progress)

## Synopsis

Web Color Picker is a vanilla JS web app that uses the [*experimental* Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) to connect to an [Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333) device.

Once a user connects to a Circuit Playground device via Web Bluetooth, they can control the colors of the Circuit Playground neopixels from the browser.
